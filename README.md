# 4tv-chess
This is a very basic chess program written in Python. Interaction occurs in stdin. Uses a user-provided copy of stockfish as the opponent. Also comes with a save file system and a save file viewer.

Note: This program lacks non-snarky commentary, and any code-reading will require a good eye and patience because none of the provided snarky commentary is useful.
